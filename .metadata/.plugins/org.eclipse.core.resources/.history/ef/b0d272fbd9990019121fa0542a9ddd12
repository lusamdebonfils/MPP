	1.
	Asymmetry, the first call gave us a false because at runtime the 
	equals on PersonWithJob object,p1 was called on the Person, 
	p2 object which is not an instance of PersonWithJob but an instance of Person 
	2.
	The second call gave us a true because we called equals of p2 on p1 which are 
	both instances of Person and only compares names.
	
	So to solve this we can use composition since their is no need for Polymorphism in this implementation
